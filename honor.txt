This page is to honor loyal TN members who have shown there support for this clan in its hard times and difficult situations. TN started out as a small clan, and it was often ridiculed by members of other larger clans. Unlike many other small ones though, its loyal members helped it survive, even after our site was deleted and members scattered. We managed to pull through low attendance, sabatoge from other clans, and a really messed up clan match. We watched through out the last year as other clans came and went, but TN still stayed active. To all the TN members have helped in our survival, thank you. <br><br>

Its an honor to be put up on this board, and hopefully, the list will be expand. <br><br>
