Hello to all you Populous Players! Team Nashua is the hub of activity among Populous clans both past and present, with a legacy running in its fourth year of superior sportsmanship, gaming ability, active forum activity, dedication, and exclusiveness. TN owes its long life to its friendly atmosphere between long time internet freinds, and as a result acceptance is generally limited and exclusive. TN is open to young talent ready to be trained and veteran Populous players with a, above all, friendly attitude and willingness to help new players. The Populous community has been growing steadily since the death of the EA server and Team Nashua has been taking complete advantage to recruit new members and grow, so now is a great time to discover the best clan in Populous! If you'd like to join our clan then go ahead and apply on the left (we may let you in if we like you). <br><br>

I changed the format of the front page a bit so it now looks a bit nicer and loads faster. If there's anything you guys would like to see out here, leave a message in the forum or send it in as an application if you're not a member. <br><br>
